# 📅 Day 1 – Excel Basics

Today, I kickstarted my Excel learning journey by creating a simple **Skill Tracker Sheet** to visualize my upcoming learning roadmap.  
I practiced working with:
- **Cell formatting** (alignment, shading, borders)  
- **Date formats** and different input styles  
- **Basic text concatenation** (combining Skill + Level)  
- A simple **difficulty rating system**

It’s a small start, but building this table helped me get comfortable with how Excel handles data and formatting.

### 💡 Key Takeaways
- Consistency matters more than complexity — one clean sheet a day builds skill fast.  
- Formatting transforms plain data into something *readable and professional*.  
- Excel formulas are way more fun once you start combining logic + design.
